<h1> Welcome to my motherfucking portfolio!</h1>
</br>
</br>
<p> I have created this webpage as a project for the freecodecamp academy lesson I am currently doing. However, I do want to take this opportunity to adequately showcase my skills and talents using code. I hope you enjoy. I will be coming back to update this with new projects periodically. Thanks for visiting! </p>

Want to get in touch with me? Be it to request more info about myself or my experience, to ask for my resume, tips on how to solve your sudoku, random questions about the universe and the meaning of life, or even if only for some nice Fika here in stunning Toronto... just feel free to drop me a line anytime.

I promise to reply A.S.A.P.

Note: No spam/soliciting pour moi, merci :)
